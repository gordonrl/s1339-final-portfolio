                <p>Hi! My name is Gordon Lewis. I'm an undergraduate at the University of Michigan majoring in Computer Science and minoring Music. In my free time I love to rock climb, play music, and code some <a href="./Projects.html">personal projects</a>, and take pictures.</p>

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>I play flute, saxophone, and guitar. While I'm fairly new to guitar (1.5 years of experience), I've been playing flute and saxophone for 10 and 8 years respectively.</p>
